################ Cache Implementation ######################
This codebase has cache implementation for direct and 4-way set associative cache. Both cache type has total 1024 lines present in it.

src/cache : Contains Cache class definition (which act as base class)

src/directMapped: Contains DirectMapped class definition which is derived class of Cache class

src/FourWayCache: Contains FourWayCache class definition which is derived class of Cache class

compileCode.tcl: Compile command for DirectMapped cache

compileCodeFourWay.tcl: Compile command for four way set associative cache

test_direct_mapped.cc: This is test code for direct mapped cache.

test_fourWayCache.cc: This is test code for 4-way set associative cache.

### How to run the code

1) Compile the code using compileCode* tcl file (Example of directMapped is provided):
   
    source compileCode.tcl

2) The binary file will be stored in bin directory. Use this command to run the code:
    
    ./bin/directMapped

    In codebase, there are debug print statement to help us unnderstand what is happening for each request.
    Different test can be tried by including the test file in compile command.
